# RGBSleep

My PC is running around the clock and it has some RGB LEDs that are somewhat annoying over night.
This tool turns them off when the PC is locked.

Thanks to MSI's SDK being ðŸ’© it needs to be run with admin permissions...

The ASUS Aura SDK sucks as well... needs to be run as admin for the first time after booting,
and its DLL crashes the program when linked dynamically instead of using LoadLibrary..
